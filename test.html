<p style="font-weight:normal;">As a branch off from my previous game, I thought it would be fun to creats ACTs for each other as well</p> <p style="font-weight:normal;">Here is a sample:</p>

    <dl><dd>> ACT </dd><dd>> Kocka<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1em;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica,Arial,HiraKakuPro-W3,HiraginoKakuGothicProW3,HiraginoKakuGothicPro,ヒラギノ角ゴProW3,メイリオ,Meiryo,游ゴシック,YuGothic,MSPゴシック,MSPGothic,MSゴシック,MSGothic,sans,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">* Check   * Garbage</p> </dd></dl>
    Cube    * Clean 

    <dl><dd>> Garbage<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1em;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica,Arial,HiraKakuPro-W3,HiraginoKakuGothicProW3,HiraginoKakuGothicPro,ヒラギノ角ゴProW3,メイリオ,Meiryo,游ゴシック,YuGothic,MSPゴシック,MSPGothic,MSゴシック,MSGothic,sans,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">* You create a redlink and throw it on the ground.</p> </dd></dl>
    Kocka destroys it and gives you an annoyed expression. 

    <dl><dd>> Cube<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1em;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica,Arial,HiraKakuPro-W3,HiraginoKakuGothicProW3,HiraginoKakuGothicPro,ヒラギノ角ゴProW3,メイリオ,Meiryo,游ゴシック,YuGothic,MSPゴシック,MSPGothic,MSゴシック,MSGothic,sans,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">* You solve the Kocka's rubix cube head.</p> </dd></dl>
    He speaks in different languages before the cube shifts back to its unsolved state. 

    <dl><dd>> Clean<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1em;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica,Arial,HiraKakuPro-W3,HiraginoKakuGothicProW3,HiraginoKakuGothicPro,ヒラギノ角ゴProW3,メイリオ,Meiryo,游ゴシック,YuGothic,MSPゴシック,MSPGothic,MSゴシック,MSGothic,sans,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">* You grab some redlinks from the floor and destroy them.</p> </dd></dl>
    Kocka seems satisfied. 

<p style="font-weight:normal;">Rules:</p> <p>
</p>

    Try to do people you know. It's more accurate and fun. 

    Don't do yourself. This is about helping each other construct their ACT.  EDIT: You can do one of yourself if you have done three legitamate menus.  

    If you want someone to do you, send them a link to this thread. You can request that someone make one for you on the tread if you contribute. But PLEASE make contributions meaningful and relevant. 

    Several people can make ACT Menus for one person. In fact, it is encouraged. 

    Don't shoot down other people's contributions. But, when making one, please don't try to be mean. Even if it's a joke. Be HONEST and let it relate to their personality.
    4 ACTS are a standard within the game, however you can do more. Please try not to do less though. 

<p style="font-weight:normal;">How You Can Use It:</p> <p style="font-weight:normal;">If you see your own ACT menu and you like it, you should add it to your profile page and quote the creator to say thanks. Or, if several people did you, you can combine them.</p> <p style="font-weight:normal;">Have Fun. I hope you all contribute to each other. LET'S MAKE SOME ACT MENUS</p>
